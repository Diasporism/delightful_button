# **The Delightful Button Demo**

A delightful button designed to bring joy to all users who click it.

## **Get Up and Running**
### **Pre-requisites:**
You'll need to have Node and Yarn installed on your machine. I recommend going with [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) but you do you.

### **Install Packages:**
```sh
$ yarn install
```

### **Run It:**
```sh
$ yarn dev
```

### **Check It Out:**
It runs on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## **Make Changes**
Modify the files in the `/src` folder. The site will auto-update as you edit these files.

The Delightful Button was made using a combination of [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://react.dev/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/). Check 'em out if you want to learn more.
